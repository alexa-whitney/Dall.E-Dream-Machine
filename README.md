# Dall-E Dream Machine

Dall-E Dream Machine is a web application that generates dream-like images based on user input. The app uses the Dall-E API from OpenAI to generate images that are both creative and surprising. 

## Getting Started

To use Dall-E Dream Machine, you will need an API key from the Dall-E API. You can sign up for an API key on the [OpenAI website](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Dall.E-Dream-Machine.git`
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project using `cd dalle-dream-machine`
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key using the following format: `API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`

### Usage

To start the app, run the following command in your terminal: `npm start`

This will start the app on port 3000. You can access the app in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

To generate an image, enter a prompt in the input field and click the "Generate Image" button. The app will send a request to the Dall-E API using your API key and display the resulting image on the page.
